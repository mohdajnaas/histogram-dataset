# histogram-dataset

Create a Python script to select only the data from "Swale at Catterick Bridge" location, and find the mean temperature and median dissolved oxygen. Also plot a histogram showing the 
distribution of temperature over the time period of study. 

# Project Description:

The Environmental Data Analysis Tool is a Python script designed for the selective extraction and analysis of environmental data, with a focus on the "Swale at Catterick Bridge" location. This project aims to streamline the process of extracting specific data from a dataset, computing statistical measures, and visualizing the distribution of temperature over a specified time period.

# Key Features:

1. Data Selection: The script enables users to filter and extract data exclusively from the "Swale at Catterick Bridge" location within a given dataset. This ensures a targeted analysis of environmental variables for this specific location.

2. Statistical Analysis:

   2.1. Mean Temperature: Compute the mean temperature of the selected data, providing insights into the average temperature at the specified location.
   2.2. Median Dissolved Oxygen: Calculate the median dissolved oxygen level, offering a robust measure of central tendency for this crucial environmental parameter.
   2.3. Histogram Plotting: Generate a histogram illustrating the distribution of temperature over the time period of the study. This visualization provides a quick overview of the temperature variations and helps identify patterns or trends.

3. Compatibility: The script supports various data formats commonly used in environmental science, such as CSV or Excel files. This flexibility ensures seamless integration with different datasets.

4. User-Friendly Input: The script may include a user-friendly interface allowing users to input the dataset file path, specify the time range of interest, and easily interpret the generated results.

# Dependencies:

The project relies on popular Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations.
